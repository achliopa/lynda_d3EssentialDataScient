## Section 1. Refresher

### Intriducing SVG

* svg is an html block element, like a blank canvas.
* svg is the first and last element (tag) of every d3 graphic. we cannot have d3 without svg
* you cannot put a div or p in an svg. only rects lines text
* d3 binds data to the svg and styles it, manipulates it
* css styling for html does not always work with svg. svg has its own css properties

* we add boilerplate html file d3.html
* we add and import a stylesheet
* we add a d3.v4.js with the lib
* we add a shapes.js for our code
* we import both javascipt files in our code
